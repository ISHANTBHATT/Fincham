    desc: `Dear Colleagues,

It is a humbling moment for me as I assume charge as Chairperson, FINCHAM India this month. It is a great honour and privilege to follow Sanjay Aggarwal (President, Fortum India Pvt. Ltd.) in this position of great responsibility. I wish to place on record my heartfelt appreciation and gratitude for the work done by my illustrious predecessors since FINCHAM was established in 2018.

Indeed, it has been an enormous journey since then as the trade between India and Finland surpassed 1 billion for the first time in 2022. This marks a significant milestone in the growing relationship between our two countries. I feel fortunate to be taking over the mantle at such an opportune time.

India’s ambitious growth agenda under a dynamic leadership affords a wide avenue for Finnish companies to use their technologically advanced products and solutions to accelerate economic development in the country. Finland will emerge as a strong, reliable partner country as India seeks to leapfrog several generations of standards and leverage the potential of Industry 4.0.

FINCHAM will continue to focus on our pronounced priorities such as : 
Sustainability – Conscious efforts in the way our member companies conduct business operations and in what we offer to our customers to meet their ESG objectives.
Ease of doing business – Engaging with the PMO, Ministry of Commerce and other industry chambers to identify difficulties and barriers and recommend mitigations.
Market navigation – Enabling our member companies to effectively navigate the regulatory landscape and achieve full compliance.
Strengthen our existing collaborations with both EU and Indian industry bodies and provide platforms for relevant B2B networking.
These and other emerging agenda items will be the attention areas as we plan our efforts for FY 2023-24. It would be great to work alongside our new Vice-Chairperson, Mr. Venkatesh Ramachandran, Managing Director, Wartsila India. I along with the Fincham Board will work on a detailed plan for 2023-24 and share the same with you in coming weeks.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank the Ambassador H.E. Ritva Koukku-Ronde and Dr Jukka Holappa, Country Manager, Business Finland, for their steadfast support to FINCHAM.

I look forward to your continued support, patronage and active participation in the Chamber’s initiatives.

Yours Sincerely,
Sanjay Malik

    desc: `Dear Industry Colleagues,

Today I look back over the last year serving as the Chairperson of Finland Chamber of Commerce in India, and I have to say it has been quite an interesting journey. I’d like to convey my heartfelt gratitude to my colleagues including the Board Members, Member Companies, colleagues from the Embassy and Business Finland for their unstinted support and tireless efforts. A special thank you to our Honorary Board Members, the Hon’ble Ambassador, H.E. Ritva Koukku-Ronde, Dr. Jukka Holappa and Mr. Tarvo Nieminen for always supporting and encouraging the Chamber’s activities enthusiastically. I would also like to express appreciation for the energetic efforts Mr. Kimmo Siira, Counsellor at the Embassy of Finland, not only for

supporting FINCHAM’s activities, but also for constantly striving to facilitate cooperative platforms for our members to conduct their business in India.

The Embassy of Finland in New Delhi continues to be an invaluable advocate of the Chamber. They have not only been active participants in our discussion meetings, but proactively supported our endeavours to find meaningful solutions to issues faced by Finnish companies in India.

After nearly two years of virtual operations, we were able to resume nearly all events and meetings in a physical format which provided a refreshing opportunity to mingle with our peers and partners. The past year was also marked by several important ministerial delegation visits to India. FINCHAM organised exclusive roundtable interactions with Hon’ble Minister of Economic Affairs, Mr. Mika Lintilä as well Hon’ble Minister of Development Cooperation & Foreign Trade of Finland, Mr. Ville Skinnari. These interactions acted as a useful platforms for companies to share key inputs – challenges as well as success stories – vis-à-vis India operations for bi-lateral discussions. Other activities included organising expert sessions on regulatory developments and issues, including IPR, Union Budget 2023, as well as impact of geo-political events for the Indian Economy.

I am delighted to share that we were able to leverage the return to ‘normalcy’ by hosting the much overdue Annual FINCHAM Gala, bringing together members, partners, customers. The event was graced by the Hon’ble Minister of Employment of Finland H.E Ms. Tuula Haatainen. The highlights ofthe event were the discussion on ‘Powering  India’s Sustainability Aspirations through Technology’ with our esteemed panelists including Dr. Sunita Purushottam (Head of Sustainability at Mahindra Lifespaces) and Mr. Siddharth Sharma (Group Chief Sustainability Officer at Tata Sons). The gala gave us an opportune moment to present Awards of Excellence to two of our strongest pillars of support, H.E. Ritva Koukku-Ronde and Dr. Jukka Holappa for their commitment and contributions towards the evolution and achievements of the Chamber.

Sustainability has been an underlying theme of significance for the Indo-Finnish cooperation. This year FINCHAM has launched a video series ‘Sustainability in Action’ –to promote visibility and showcase the sustainability driven strategies and objectives of the Finnish companies in India. I would like to thank Business Finland in India for supporting us with this initiative. Another effort to promote awareness about our member companies was the release of the 1st Edition of the FINCHAM Handbook. As the FINCHAM community continues to grow, the Chamber would be publishing annual additions of the Members’ Handbook with a view to disseminate key information about the companies’ innovative offerings in the India market to relevant stakeholders.

Finland was granted Focus Country status at the Silver Jubilee Edition of the International Engineering and Technology Fair held in New Delhi in February 2023. This is the 2nd time that FINCHAM has partnered with CII for this flagship bi-annual event. The IETF 2023 was inaugurated by the Hon’ble President of India Smt. Droupadi Murmu. In her inaugural speech, Hon’ble President appreciated Finland and FINCHAM India for their cooperation as Partner Country at this event in recognition of the country’s expertise in innvovation and technology. The Country Pavilion hosted by FINCHAM displayed and distributed information about the member companies’ India presence.

Moving on to another significant initiative, I am proud to share that the 1st joint CSR initiative ‘Project Resilient Schools’ in Delhi/NCR was successfully completed in August 2022, improving water and sanitation access to children and students of 3 primary Municipal schools. Significant progress has also been made in the on-going 2nd project (Green Village Upliftment Program) being implemented in Pune District Maharashtra. We look forward to more of such meaningful joint initiatives by the Finnish business community.

I would continue my efforts towards the success of FINCHAM as a member of the Board, and look forward to more occasions for us to brainstorm issues, find solutions, strengthen partnerships with governments, explore opportunities, showcase achievements, initiatives and unique offerings of the member companies, organize joint events with other Industry associations and enhance the Chamber’s visibility and outreach.

Once again, I’d like to thank all our members, without whose support we would not have come this far. As I hand over the reigns to Mr. Sanjay Malik (Sr VP and Head of India Market, Nokia) and Mr. Venkatesh Ramchandran (MD, Wartsila India) as the new Chairperson and Vice Chairperson of the Chamber, I wish them both the very best for a great journey ahead!

Yours Sincerely,
Sanjay Aggarwal

      "CII And Finland Chamber Of Commerce In India (FINCHAM India) Enter Into An MoU For Sustainability And Smart Cities Cooperation",
    date: "April 25, 2022",
    desc: `New Delhi, 19 April,2022: Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and Finland Chamber of Commerce in India (FINCHAM) have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in areas of infrastructure projects, smart cities and sustainable development in India. CII and FINCHAM will explore the possibility of associating and bringing together other Technology/Infrastructure Solution Partners, as cohesive group, in relation to certain infrastructure projects and other business initiatives coming up in India, including setting up and development of Smart Cities (“Smart Cities”). 

CII & FINCHAM are also keen to explore the possibility of associating and bringing together government and corporate sector action towards climate change and sustainable development. The MoU will provide a platform for the Finnish and Indian companies to collaborate towards the national sustainability agenda with focus on circular economy, climate action and air quality. The association can leverage existing platforms of CII like Clean Air Better Life forum, India Plastics Pact and Climate Charter to deepen the relationships. This MoU would promote high-level engagements between leading Finnish and Indian businesses on Sustainability driven themes and exchange of best practices and learnings between Indian and Finnish private sector players.

Elaborating on the collaboration, Mr. Sanjay Aggarwal, Chairperson, FINCHAM India and President, Fortum India said, “FINCHAM has been partnering with CII on several flagship activities, including the IETF and Annual Sustainability Summits.  We are confident that this MoU would be an important step in not only strengthening the cooperation between the two  chambers, but also provide a platform for the Indian and Finnish corporate sectors to combine innovative expertise on the relevant national agendas – Smart Cities and Sustainability. We are hopeful that this collaboration with CII would translate into initiatives which would be complimentary to the sustainability and �?green growth’ driven partnership announced by the two countries’ Prime Ministers in March last year.”

Following the signing ceremony, Ms. Seema Arora, Deputy Director General, CII shared, “CII has facilitated Industry’s evolution and progress through the pioneering initiatives on green building, climate change, circular economy, air pollution, plastics use, biodiversity conservation, resource efficiency, waste management and many more. Through this MoU, we are looking forward to help Finnish and Indian companies to collaborate in driving the sustainability agenda by leveraging our existing initiatives like Cleaner Air-Better Life, India Plastics Pact, Climate Action Charter.”

The MoU was signed in the presence of the Hon’ble Minister of Economic Affairs & Employment of Finland, Mr. Mika Lintilä, who is presently visiting India along with a Finnish business delegation, and the Hon’ble Minister of State for External Affairs, Ms. Meenakshi Lekhi. Speaking on the occasion, Minister Lintilä said, “India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Finnish companies operating in India across different sectors have expertise that India’s growing and developing economy needs. I warmly welcome the collaboration between FINCHAM and CII to strengthen the win-win business cooperation between Finland and India”

    desc: `Dear Industry Colleagues,

Today, I am honored and privileged to take over the mantle of Chairperson, FINCHAM India from able hands of M C Suresh Kumar (Managing Director, Cargotec India). It’s been quite a fruitful and satisfying journey since late 2017, when the idea of Finnish Chamber was first proposed by the previous Finnish Ambassador to India H.E. Nina Vaskunlahti and was actively pursued by then Counsellor at Embassy of Finland, Mr. Mikko Pötsönen. There were intense and active debates on the vision of the chamber, its structure, governance model, regulatory challenges, which have continued till date as we evolve, and after necessary formalities, we finally had the first board meeting of FINCHAM on 13th December, 2018. Starting with Neeraj Sharma as the first Chairperson, followed by Amit Gossain and M C Suresh Kumar, FINCHAM today has firmly established its roots and is 26 members strong. It has been amazing to watch my predecessors putting enormous energy, active interest, passion and zeal into managing and growing the Chamber. Along the way, FINCHAM navigated its way through the first, second and third wave of Covid. While this prevented us from holding physical meetings, we more than made up by online interactions and it never felt that there was something amiss. Of course, virtual meetings could never replace the face-to-face banter over copious cups of coffee and cookies or tranquil and sometimes boisterous dinners on the lawns of Embassy of Finland.

I cannot thank enough the Ambassador H.E. Ritva Koukku-Ronde and Dr Jukka Holappa, Country Manager, Business Finland, for supporting FINCHAM and their active encouragement by gracing all our meetings, actively participating in our discussions and finding solutions to issues that at times are faced by Finnish companies in India.

We have many challenges this year, with runaway commodity prices due to adverse geopolitical events, inflation rearing its head, era of easy liquidity coming to an end, hardening of interest rates, adverse foreign exchange movement, the euphoria of end of Covid has been tempered. All the companies including our members would have to rework their assumptions, finely pencil their expansion program and be cautiously optimistic as the environment has suddenly turned extremely uncertain and risk perceptions have gone up multi-fold. However, there are opportunities galore as always. One needs to separate the noise that’s all around us, and we could still find our niches and it is in these niches that Finnish companies have always prospered and added value.

We at the Chamber would continue our efforts to bring together member companies, brainstorm issues facing us, find solutions, strengthen partnerships with state governments, explore opportunities, showcase achievements, initiatives and unique offerings of the member companies, organize joint events with other Industry associations and enhance the Chamber’s visibility and reach. Our joint CSR activities have been well received and we will continue and in fact enhance our efforts in that direction going forward.

It would be great to work alongside our new Vice-Chairperson, Mr. Sanjay Malik (Senior VP and Head of India Market, Nokia), who has been a founder member and Board Member since inception of the Chamber and has been instrumental in shaping FINCHAM as it stands now.

The journey continues….

Yours Sincerely,

Sanjay Aggarwal

    desc: `Valmet’s climate program includes ambitious CO₂ emission reduction targets and concrete actions across the value chain.   

Climate change and global warming are significant challenges that are driving companies to rapidly transform and reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. Valmet believes that technology plays a key role in mitigating climate change and global warming in the transition to a carbon neutral economy. 

Therefore, we have created an ambitious climate program − Forward to a carbon neutral future − which continues our comprehensive sustainability work. Carbon neutrality means a balance between emitted and absorbed carbon. Achieving zero carbon dioxide emissions is possible by eliminating or offsetting carbon dioxide emissions.  ​ 

Ambitious targets and concrete actions across the value chain 
Valmet’s climate program includes ambitious CO₂ emission reduction targets and concrete actions across the value chain, including the supply chain, our own operations and customers’ use of Valmet’s technologies.  

The program is aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement’s 1.5-degree pathway and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Valmet is also in the process of sending its climate targets to the Science Based Targets Initiative for validation. 

“Our climate program covers the entire value chain, and with concrete actions, we will significantly reduce our own carbon footprint and support our suppliers in doing so too. Valmet is also strongly committed to being our customers’ preferred partner on their journey to carbon neutrality,” says Pasi Laine, President and CEO, Valmet. 

Collaboration with suppliers       ​ 
Valmet’s supply chain accounts for approximately 4 percent of the carbon footprint of the company’s value chain. Our target is to reduce CO₂ emissions in the supply chain by 20 percent by 2030.  

“We’re proceeding with a wide range of actions like decreasing the weight of our products, increasing the share of recycled steel they contain, and introducing alternative materials. We will support our CO₂-intensive suppliers in reducing their emissions and centralize spend on selected suppliers offering low-carbon transportation. We will also continue to develop freight planning,” says Jani Suomalainen, Vice President, Procurement, Valmet. 

Transforming our own operations     ​ 
Valmet’s own operations account for approximately 1 percent of the carbon footprint of the company’s value chain. We are targeting a reduction of 80 percent of CO₂ emissions in our own operations by 2030 without emission compensation. 

“We’re driving this transformation by replacing fossil fuels with renewables in our locations, purchasing CO₂-free electricity and district heat, and implementing energy efficiency improvements. We are enhancing the use of digital tools and further developing remote working to reduce business travel emissions​. We will also promote low-carbon commuting,” says Laura Puustjärvi, Head of Sustainability, Valmet. 

 Carbon neutral processes for customers​ 
As most of the carbon footprint of Valmet’s value chain originates in the use phase of Valmet’s technologies, the program emphasizes our current and future ability to enable 100 percent carbon neutral production for our customers.  

Valmet’s current multifuel and bioenergy boiler technology already enables 100 percent fossil-free heat and power production today. Our target is to enable carbon neutral production for all our pulp and paper industry customers by 2030 as well. We will achieve this target by developing new technologies that enable fossil-free pulp and paper production when the customer is using carbon neutral electricity. 

Our second target is to further improve the energy efficiency of our current technology offering by 20 percent by 2030. We will achieve this target by developing the energy efficiency of our portfolio, and offering our services and automation solutions to further optimize the production processes in the installed base.  

“Today, customers’ chemical pulp mills utilizing our technologies are often more than 100 percent bioenergy self-sufficient already, and our current bioenergy boiler offering enables 100 percent fossil-ree heat and power production. Our customers have set ambitious climate goals themselves, and Valmet has an essential role in helping to achieve them,” says Janne Pynnönen, Vice President, Research and Development, Valmet.
